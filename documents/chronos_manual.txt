PROJECT CHRONOS-7: CONFIDENTIAL TECHNICAL LOG
Author: Dr. Elias Vance
Date: October 14, 2042

The Chronos-7 Quantum Synthesizer is the first functional prototype capable of localized temporal displacement. It is powered not by traditional electricity, but by refined Aetherium crystals housed within the primary combustion chamber. 

Operating parameters are strictly defined. The core must be maintained at exactly -45 degrees Celsius. If the temperature exceeds -10 degrees Celsius, the Aetherium crystals will destabilize, triggering a catastrophic temporal feedback loop. 

In the event of an impending destabilization, operators must immediately initiate "Protocol Omega-Black." This protocol forcefully ejects the crystal matrix into the sub-basement containment grid and floods the primary chamber with liquid nitrogen, permanently disabling the machine but saving the facility. 

Maintenance notes: The primary cooling vents must be cleared of temporal frost every 14 hours. Failure to do so will result in a 15% drop in Aetherium efficiency.
